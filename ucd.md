## Undergraduate

I was an undergraduate student at UC Davis from 2017-2021 studying mechanical engineering. I graduated with honors and a GPA of 3.8/4.0. I mostly took engineering classes, but got to take a diverse range of classes outside of engineering as well including economics, environmental design, and technical writing. Some of the notable engineering classes I took include:

* Welding
* Machining
    * I built a gyroscope out of aluminum by operating mills, lathes, and drill presses.
* Drafting
* Circuits
* Statics and dynamics
* Stability and controls
* Thermodynamics and heat transfer
* Solid and fluid mechanics
* Mechanism design

...and more.

### UC PLASMA

UC PLASMA was an intense, 14-week long business startup competition open to current students and alumni of all UC campuses. My most trusted friend and I worked together in a team of 2 to build our company called _Assist-X_ around the needs of at-home medical equipment. Our first product was called _AccuDropper_, a handheld, automatic eyedrop dispenser targeted for people with visual impairments or motor disabilities. By the end of the competition, each startup pitched their idea to a panel of judges. _Assist-X_ won __both__ the most improved award and first place overall.

### Senior Design

In 2021, I worked in a team of 6 to design a device that would aid in the research of neurobiology. Our device was to keep the head of a mouse still to conduct brain scans while allowing the rest of the mouse to experience natural movement. Our team came up with a spherical treadmill for the mouse to run on, surrounded by virtual reality screens to emulate being in a maze. We called this, the _Oculus Mouse_.

### Engineer In Training

In February of 2021, I took and passed the FE and obtained my EIT license.

## Graduate

I started my graduate education in Fall of 2021 as a master's student in mechanical and aerospace engineering. I am currently working towards my degree and expecting to graduate by June of 2022. I am tailoring my focus towards computational science and analysis. Some of the key courses that I have taken include:

* Computer Aided Mechanical Design
* Advanced Data Visualization
* Advanced Energy Systems
* Experimental Uncertainty
