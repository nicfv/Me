## Critical Facilities Engineer Associate

I was hired at [NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/) (the National Energy Research Scientific Computing center) as a Critical Facilities Engineer Associate in 2022. I will be developing new and more efficient control programs, assisting with the safe operation modes during critical environmental conditions, such as poor air quality, and leading the development and adoption of our asset management software.

## Graduate Student Assistant

I was hired as a graduate student research assistant in 2021. NERSC is a large data center with powerful and energy efficient supercomputers used for science, located within Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. My job was to support the effort of monitoring environmental data within the facility to detect anomalies and help improve the overall efficiency of the data center.

My first project was to validate a set of data points that we collect from physical sensors accessed in our building management system. This meant to validate IDs and physical units attached to each data point. I was able to write a program to let a user select points from an interface to generate a formatted list of these data points. The formatted list allows us to easily inject the data into a monitoring database. Using this data, I created visuals using the Grafana program to help closely monitor environmental conditions and the coefficient of performance of the facility. In addition, I created a self-updating dashboard of the power usage effectiveness which was used to report data to LBL and also shared with the energy efficient high performance computing working group (EEHPCWG).

A notable project was building up a visual interface to plot thermophysical air properties on a psychrometric chart dubbed [Psychart](https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/ventura-psychrometric-panel/).  Using this tool has great benefits for HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning), meteorological, and chemical applications. It integrates directly into Grafana, and supports the processing and plotting of many air data points in real time. Having this visual capability is extremely useful during heat waves to quickly assess data center health.
