# About Me

![me](./me.jpg)

## Welcome to my website!

Hello, world! My name is Nicolas Ventura, or Nic. I am recently graduated from the Univerisity of California, at Davis. I graduated in 2021 with a B.S. in mechanical engineering and again in 2022 with a master's degree in mechanical and aerospace engineering, with a focus on computational science and analysis. I am EIT certified since February, 2021, and have had several diverse experiences, ranging from competing in a business startup incubator, to game development, to energy efficiency. I'm currently working as a Critical Facilities Engineer Associate for [NERSC](https://www.nersc.gov/) and working on several projects ranging from real-time environmental data monitoring to asset management.

Aside from engineering, I am also passionate about running, biking, and camping, as well as skiing in the winter time. Because I am currently living in northern California, the mountains at Lake Tahoe are one of my favorite places to ski. My photography from my travels can be found at [one of my other websites](https://photos.nicfv.com/). I can speak English, French, and a little bit of Spanish. I also am a connoisseur of all things Star Wars. Feel free to send me an [email](mailto:hire@nicfv.com) if you would like to talk about any interests that we share, or if you are interested in working together!
