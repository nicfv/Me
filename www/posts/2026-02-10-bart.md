# Speed of Transit to Work

A while ago, I wrote about how long it took me to take [public transit to work](./2024-10-18-public-transit.md) compared to driving. Since then, Clipper cards (the payment method for transit in the Bay Area) have rolled out their 2.0 upgrade, which makes inter-agency transfers significantly cheaper, or even free. On the other hand, the bridge toll for driving has increased every year. Let's compare this again, with an interesting twist. On the ride to work, the weather was clear and sunny. On the ride home, it was raining. How much does poor weather conditions affect a commute in the Bay Area? You're about to find out.

## Timetables

Thanks to our heavily-measured society, I know exactly the dates and timestamps of when I got on and got off at various different transfer points using the Clipper website (or app.)

## To Work

In the morning, the weather was clear.

| Agency | Line | Entry | Exit | Duration | Cost |
| ------ | ---- | ----- | ---- | -------- | ---- |
| GGT | 101 | 6:37AM | 6:56AM | 0:19 | \\$1.80 |
| GGT | 580X | 6:56AM | 7:24AM | 0:28 | \\$0.00 |
| BART | Red | 7:30AM | 7:44AM | 0:14 | \\$0.00 |

> *Not included:* Free Berkeley Lab shuttle from BART station to work.

- Total moving time: 1:01
- Total waiting time: 0:06
- Total travel time: 1:07

I estimate a waiting time of around 10 minutes and an additional travel time of 10 minutes for the shuttle, making my total travel time around 1:30 and my total cost \\$1.80.
