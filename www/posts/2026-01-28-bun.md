# Switching from `npm` to Bun

When I first heard of Bun, I thought, "it's just another one of the hundreds of JavaScript frameworks out there." And it is, sort of. So why is there so much hype? At least, relatively. If you're not a computer nerd, you probably think I'm talking about rolls of bread. It does have a fun name.

## The Twins

Up until recently, I had 2 public repositories for various projects: `Tools` (accessible via ~~tools.nicfv.com~~) and `Games` (via ~~games.nicfv.com~~). Despite the fact that "tools" and "games" are very different pieces of software, the repositories were more or less identical to each other. Both of them depended on npm, NodeJS, TypeScript, eslint, and WebPack. I've learned that this is a *very* typical NodeJS setup. In addition, both of them had practically identical GitHub workflows for building, packaging, and pushing updates to GitHub Pages.

Managing 2 identical repositories isn't that big of a hassle, but I'm someone that *hates* duplicating work when not necessary. I'll automate the crap out of something, spending hours doing it just to save a few seconds here and there. I know, illogical. Anyway, an idea I had for some time is to combine them into a single repository, similar to what I've done in both my [GitHub Repository Cleanup](./2024-02-26-github.md) and [npm Monorepo](./2024-12-07-npm-monorepo.md) stories.

## New Repo

The first step was coming up with a name. In the recent months, I've decided to stop all my creative thinking and offload it to AI. That way, I can hold the things that really matter in my brain, like Pokemon evolutions. Smart, right? I had a chat with Google Gemini and it suggested a few names, my top contenders were:

- Labs (labs.nicfv.com or lab.nicfv.com)
- Workshop (workshop.nicfv.com)
- Apps (apps.nicfv.com or app.nicfv.com)

As a certified fan of short domain names, I decided on the 3-letter `app` name. It's specific enough to know what is contained in the website, but general enough to know that it's not *just* games or tools.
