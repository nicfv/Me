# Sugar Rush

For Christmas, my girlfriend and I received a lot of gifts, most of them containing chocolate.

## The Haul

- 1 bag of **Ghirardelli** peppermint bark chocolates.
- 1 **chocolate orange**, cut into chocolate orange slices.
- 4 sticks of chocolate from *Goumas*, a candy store in Ohio.
- 1 box of **buckeyes** from an Amish grocery store in Ohio.
- 2 **Dubai chololates**. Everyone loves 'em, just gotta find out how well chocolate and pistachios go together!
- 21 triangular prisms of **Toblerone**. That's right, count 'em. **21**.
- And a partridge in a pear tree?
