# Replaying Pokemon Heartgold

Unfortunately, this past week I mysteriously got really sick, took some time off work and really didn't do that much. It put a red light onto doing anything physical; so absolutely no running. I stayed home and did the one thing that would make me feel better - I broke out my old Nintendo DS and started a new playthough on the best game in the world. Or, the best game in Johto - Pokemon Heartgold!

Pokemon Heartgold is a remake of an old GameBoy Color game called Pokemon Gold, with an additional Kanto region postgame. And boy did GameFreak remake it. The graphics are incredible (for the Nintendo DS), the music is fantastic, and this game includes all Gen I-IV Pokemon, which is well in the several hundreds.

I first booted up the game and checked on my old save file. I had made it to Olivine City with 5 badges or so, and I had surprisingly chosen the grass starter, Chikorita, which had evolved into a Bayleef. I say that's surprising because I don't usually go for the grass starter, but I think it's something I wanted to try in that playthough.

I wiped my save data, and started a new file, naming myself `Nicnac` and choosing the fire-type starter, Cyndaquil which I later named `Roary`.
