## Teaching Assistantship

I was the sole TA of _Computer Aided Mechanism Design_, a relatively small course with 25 students. I was responsible for holding a discussion section (1 hour per week) and lab sections (3 hours per week) as well as grading all the assignments, and helping students by email outside of class hours. The professor himself was responsible for creating assignments and hosting lectures.

I worked many hours per week to grade assignments and to set up slide decks and examples for my class sessions. I often listened in on the professor's lectures to make sure that I was on the right track with my own lesson plan. I also set up a Google Form to allow students to provide anonymous feedback on my lessons or ask questions on the material, which I made sure to cover in the next class meeting. In my class sessions, I explained the examples step by step and frequently opened the floor to questions. Since all classes were remote at this time, I recorded my classes using Zoom and made the recordings available to students so they could rewatch them at any time.

To organize my grading, I would keep a log in Excel whenever I marked points off students' assignments. This log was used as a key to describe the error and points deducted, so the grading was fair across all students in the class. I wrote explanations to the students for any missed points and also made sure that the students knew they could come to me with questions afterwards or to let me know if I had made a mistake in grading.

The students were all very successful in their final project to write a software package to simulate a certain mechanism indicating that I prepared them well for the challenge.
