## Teaching Assistantship

My favorite undergraduate class was called _Computer Aided Mechanism Design_. Designing and simulating the linkages and other mechanisms was genuinely a lot of fun. After I was accepted as a graduate student at UC Davis, I emailed my professor for that class asking if he was looking for a new TA. Sure enough, the TA whom I had when I was in this class was now a full time professor, so I was offered the job.

_Computer Aided Mechanism Design_ was a relatively small course with 25 students, so I was the only TA. I was responsible for holding a discussion section (1 hour per week) and lab sections (3 hours per week) as well as grading all the assignments, and helping students by email outside of class hours. The professor himself was responsible for creating assignments and hosting lectures.

I worked many hours per week setting up slide decks and examples for my class sessions. I often listened in on the professor's lectures to make sure that I was on the right track with my own lesson plan. I also set up a Google Form to allow students to provide anonymous feedback on my lessons or ask questions on the material, which I made sure to cover in the next class meeting. In my class sessions, I explained the examples step by step and frequently opened the floor to questions. Since all classes were remote at this time, I recorded my classes using Zoom and made the recordings available to students so they could rewatch them at any time.

As far as grading goes, I tried to be as gentle and fair as possible. Whenever a student missed a part of a question, I would keep a log in Excel as a key for myself where I would describe the error and record how many points I deducted. I wrote explanations to the students for any missed points and also made sure that the students knew they could always come to me with questions afterwards or if I had made a mistake in grading.

Throughout the class, it was easy to see that the students were progressing. Thier final project was to write a software package to simulate a certain mechanism, in which they all did very well. It made me feel like I had accomplished what I came for.
