# Tools

Occasionally I need a specialized calculator or other piece of software, where the top match online doesn't fit my needs or is horrible to use. Or maybe, doesn't exist at all! When you want something done right, you need to do it yourself. This website is a focal point for all these mini-tools I've created. Maybe you, the viewer, will find some of them useful. Use the navigation bar on the left to direct yourself to the different tools I've made. Alternatively, the list below contains tools I've built, but the links will take you to a subdomain of this website.
