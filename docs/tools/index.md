# Tools

Occasionally I need a specialized piece of software or calculation tool that I either can't find online or the one that exists doesn't fit my needs or is horrible to use. I'll be using this website as a composite for all these mini-tools I create so I have a centralized location for them, and maybe you, the viewer, may find some of them useful. Use the navigation bar on the left to direct yourself to the different tools I've made. Alternatively, here are a few I've built, that exist on external websites.

- [Psychart](https://psychart.nicfv.com/) - *Plot thermodynamic conditions of air on a psychrometric chart, optionally displaying comfort zones.*
- [Wordle Helper](https://wordle.nicfv.com/) - *Filters the wordle dictionary based on your previous guesses to help you make an informed next guess.*
