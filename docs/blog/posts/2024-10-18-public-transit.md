# Public Transit to Work

I'm fortunate not to need it, but I tried taking public transit to work today! Simply as an experiment. I had mapped out a few different routes and decided on one that would have the fewest transfers, even if it took a bit longer. This will read a bit less like a story and more like a bulleted list of chronological events. So, if that's not your cup of tea, you might want to skip this one.

- 5:50 AM: Woke up
- 6:20 AM: Leave home
  - Walk over to Novato transit hub on Redwood & Grant
- 6:27 AM: Get on 154 commuter bus (Golden Gate Transit)
  - The bus was really nice, clean, and really empty. Only 3 or 4 other people on board.
  - The Clipper card reader was broken, so I didn't pay for the ride. From an online search, my ride would have normally cost $7.80.
  - It made several stops in Novato before actually getting on the highway.
- 6:39 AM: Bus enters the on-ramp for highway 101 South.
- 7:05 AM: Bus arrives at Golden Gate toll plaza
  - It was awesome being a passenger while someone else was driving across the bridge. I got to take some cool pictures.
  - During this time, I also started my work day and got some work done on the bus.
- 7:27 AM: Bus arrives at my stop (Battery & Pine)
  - It's cold out in San Francisco, so I'm glad I brought a jacket.
  - Walk over to Embarcadero BART station
- 7:32 AM: Arrive at BART station platform
- 7:35 AM: The Red line to Richmond arrives at the platform
- 8:00 AM: BART arrives at the Downtown Berkeley station
  - Walk over to the lab shuttle stop
- 8:05 AM: Board the blue shuttle to Berkeley Lab
- 8:14 AM: The blue shuttle arrives at Blackberry gate
  - Walk over to NERSC
- 8:16 AM: Arrive at NERSC
