# Owning Property, (Almost) Two Years Later

It's crazy to think, but coming up on two years now, I [purchased my condo](./2024-06-14-buying-house.md). I absolutely love it and have no regrets, but there are some things I wish I had considered. Here's a short story of what I wished I could tell myself those 2 years ago, and things (specific to me) that are really important in finding a place to live.

## The House Itself

I want to make sure I live in a place that has the amenities I need above things I want. For that, I would need to create a list of things I am looking for in a place to live and then sort them into two categories.

### Things I Need

- **Washer/Dryer**: An absolute must for me. I've lived in apartments with and without a washer/dryer in-unit, and it was very annoying to go down to the laundry room to discover that half the laundry machines are broken and the other half still have an hour left on the timer. Paying to do your laundry is also just a slap in the face. Why would I pay for something I don't want to do in the first place?
- **Dishwasher**: Luckily, I've never lived in a place without one, but I already can tell you that it would get old, *fast*, if I didn't have a dishwasher.
- **Central A/C**: California gets *HOT* in the summer. In the east bay, it can easily get over 100s and stay there for weeks at a time, and in the central valley, we're talking 110s. I think we even had heat waves where it peaked over 120 degrees F. It also cools down much more slowly, the further you are away from the San Francisco Bay.
- **Reserved Parking**: I own a car, which means I need a place to put it. Simple as that.

### Things I Want

- **Car Port or Garage**: This isn't absolutely necessary, depending on the weather and safety of where I live. Essentially I just need a *safe* place to put my car, away from falling branches, and ideally off the street.
- **Central Heating**: It doesn't get as cold in this area, plus I actually like the cold. On very cold days I might like to run the heater, but if I need to add more layers, or get a space heater instead, so be it.
- **New appliances**: This is definitely nice to have, as it will save me a great deal of money after move-in if I don't need to replace anything.
- **Private outdoor space**: At the other places I've lived, I enjoy working from home outdoors, or just sitting outdoors reading or on my computer. This would also open the option of ever getting a dog in the future.
- **Fiber internet**: I plan to work from home sometimes and a fast internet would be helpful for this. Fiber is a relatively new technology in this area, and most houses or apartments don't have the infrastructure yet, so it's not something I can realistically expect to find in affordable homes.
- **No upstairs/downstairs neighbors**: The last thing I want is to put a several-thousand-dollar down payment on an apartment and discover that the upstairs neighbors run an at-home jackhammer-testing service. I'm putting this on the "want" list since it may not be realistic to expect to find an affordable place with this requirement.
