# Owning Property, (Almost) Two Years Later

It's crazy to think, but coming up on two years now, I [purchased my condo](./2024-06-14-buying-house.md). I absolutely love it and have no regrets, but there are some things I wish I had considered. Here's a short story of what I wished I could tell myself those 2 years ago, and things (specific to me) that are really important in finding a place to live.

## The Location

Location is often said to be the most important factor in choosing a place to live. That is definitely said with reason.

### Proximity to Work

This is something I thought of extensively before buying a house. My requirement was to have a commute time less than my current living situation, at my parents' house. I was able to find that, but I wish I pushed this further. My commute time is around 45 minutes on average, and sometimes up to an hour when traffic gets really bad. I could have spent 10% more to live about 30% closer to work in a different city. There were other reasons why I didn't do that, but I definitely should have weighed this a bit more.

I need to cross the Richmond-San Rafael bridge to get to work. This is a toll bridge, which I factored in. A new development is that the toll rates are undergoing a significant increase in 2025.

### Your City

Unless you move to a rural area, you likely live in a town or city of some sort. What is the community like? What is the cost of living in that area? I wished I determined my priorities first and then chose a city with those same priorities.

- Maintaining local parks, clean and **free** public areas and facilities, and well maintained roads
- Quiet and safe environment, with a lot of green space
- Proximity to national/state/regional parks
- Ways to reduce traffic, for example keeping a walkable and bikeable area
- Having all essential amentities within the city, like medical, dental, shopping, gas, and several food options
    - Not needing to leave town for groceries for example
- Entertainment options, like movies, bowling, possibly more exotic activities like escape rooms or axe throwing
- Lower cost of living, going out to eat will not make you poor for the next month
- Large population of people in their 20s and 30s

### Transportation Alternatives

Something I hadn't considered at all were alternatives to driving everywhere I needed to go. I got lucky in this regard. I ended up in a condo where I could walk almost everywhere. Two grocery stores, a postal office, my barber, several food options, a hardware store, pharmacy, pet store, and the dollar store were just a short walk away. Downtown, with even more options, was a slightly longer walk away but I could still get there in under 20 minutes on foot.

There also turned out to be two well-established transit organizations in my town. The incredibly cheap [Marin Transit](https://marintransit.org/) with 3 bus lines in my town to different destinations within the county, and [Golden Gate](https://www.goldengate.org/) transit, with 2 bus lines in my town, going either to San Francisco or Santa Rosa. A few towns over, Golden Gate offers two ferry routes to San Francisco. Technically, I don't need a car at all to get anywhere in the bay area. I could take the bus to SF and then BART for example.

If/when I move, this will definitely be taken into consideration. I think living a walkable area is the most important, with transit options coming second.

## The House Itself

I want to make sure I live in a place that has the amenities I need above things I want. For that, I would need to create a list of things I am looking for in a place to live and then sort them into two categories.

### Things I Need

- **Washer/Dryer**: An absolute must for me. I've lived in apartments with and without a washer/dryer in-unit, and it was very annoying to go down to the laundry room to discover that half the laundry machines are broken and the other half still have an hour left on the timer. Paying to do your laundry is also just a slap in the face. Why would I pay for something I don't want to do in the first place?
- **Dishwasher**: Luckily, I've never lived in a place without one, but I already can tell you that it would get old, *fast*, if I didn't have a dishwasher.
- **Central A/C**: California gets *HOT* in the summer. In the east bay, it can easily get over 100s and stay there for weeks at a time, and in the central valley, we're talking 110s. I think we even had heat waves where it peaked over 120 degrees F. It also cools down much more slowly, the further you are away from the San Francisco Bay.
- **Reserved Parking**: I own a car, which means I need a place to put it. Simple as that.

### Things I Want

- **Car Port or Garage**: This isn't absolutely necessary, depending on the weather and safety of where I live. Essentially I just need a *safe* place to put my car, away from falling branches, and ideally off the street.
- **Central Heating**: It doesn't get as cold in this area, plus I actually like the cold. On very cold days I might like to run the heater, but if I need to add more layers, or get a space heater instead, so be it.
- **New appliances**: This is definitely nice to have, as it will save me a great deal of money after move-in if I don't need to replace anything.
- **Private outdoor space**: At the other places I've lived, I enjoy working from home outdoors, or just sitting outdoors reading or on my computer. This would also open the option of ever getting a dog in the future.
- **Fiber internet**: I plan to work from home sometimes and a fast internet would be helpful for this. Fiber is a relatively new technology in this area, and most houses or apartments don't have the infrastructure yet, so it's not something I can realistically expect to find in affordable homes.
- **No upstairs/downstairs neighbors**: The last thing I want is to put a several-thousand-dollar down payment on an apartment and discover that the upstairs neighbors run an at-home jackhammer-testing service. I'm putting this on the "want" list since it may not be realistic to expect to find an affordable place with this requirement.
