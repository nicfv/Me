# Bay Front Run 2024

On October 6, I raced in the [Bay Front Run](https://www.bayfrontrun.com/)! This is an annual 5K along the Bay Front Trail in Hercules, CA, which benefits the Hercules Education Foundation. I forgot to write about this achievement, so here it is, well over a month later.

I originally heard about this race through my dad, since his work is one of the main sponsors of this event. There were options to sign up for a 1-mile, 5K, or 10K. I decided to do the 5K, since the course for the 10K was just the 5K course repeated twice, so it wouldn't be that interesting for me. The 5K was already an out-and-back course, which was an interesting design for a race, to say the least.

I planned to take this race seriously, but I definitely did not train as hard as I should have. I averaged a bit under 20 miles per week for the few weeks leading up to the race. I benchmarked myself a few times, and some of my better runs were a 5:48 mile, and a 2-miler with the average pace of 6:43/mi. I continued running with both of my [running clubs](./2024-09-08-marina-run-club.md) for additional training.

We had a horrible heat wave during the week leading up to the race. Several cities in the east bay were hitting in the 100s, including Hercules. On race day, Hercules peaked at 103 F. Thankfully, the race was scheduled early in the morning when it was cool, with a nice gentle bay breeze. I had to park a bit out of the way, but still pretty close to the starting line. As I walked over to the gathering area, I saw vendors setting up their booths for the Bay Front Festival. I met my parents who also came to support me. I picked up my bib (#270) and T-shirt, and lined up for the race. There was a trainer there that guided us all through stretches before gun time.

*Pew!*

The race started, and I was in the middle of the pack, but slowly inching my way forward. I watched the Amtrak go by. I pushed myself harder. Eventually I got to a point where I couldn't see anyone in front of me, although I thought there were a few people still in front of me further ahead. At this point, I was really straining myself, unsustainably. I looked back and there was one guy pretty close to me so I eased off the gas a bit for him to catch up to my pace. His name was Ayden, and he also thought he saw two guys ahead of us. Now running together, we were able to motivate each other and keep a fast and steady pace.

Since we were so far away from everyone, it was really confusing where to turn around. Ayden and I kept pushing ourselves until we saw two guys zoom by us going back to the starting line. That confirmed we were heading in the right direction, but a little disheartening to know that we weren't in front. Finally, we found the turnaround point, with only one volunteer showing us the direction.

As we ran back, we passed all the racers behind us, which was a bit awkward, especially on the portion with a narrow bridge. Ayden and I split up and I kicked it into high gear. I don't normally feel this way running but I definitely felt like throwing up. I held myself back and sprinted back through the rows of vendors at the Bay Front Festival. (Again, weird path design!) I finished the 5K with the time 21:30, or an average pace of 6:56/mi! One of the volunteers rushed over to give me water and congratulating me on finishing first! Between heavy breaths, I explained that there were 2 others in front of me. Turns out, one of them was racing the 10K, but she simply missed the other runner as he finished. His name was Connor. He walked over and she congratulated him. Soon after, Ayden came through the finish line, completing the 3 podium spots.

Out of the 139 runners that raced, I came in 2nd overall! Results: [All](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/67243#resultSetId-496988;perpage:5000) | [Individual](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/67243/IndividualResult/cdBR?resultSetId=496988#U93168241)

After the race, my parents and I went to Powder Keg for a brunch where I got eggs and impossible sausage (tasted like the real thing!) Then, we got some snacks and freebies at the Bay Front Festival. We left just as it was starting to get hot.
