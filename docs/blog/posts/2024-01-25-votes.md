# Minimum Popular Vote

The US electoral college has its flaws, but forget about that. I'm curious what the minimum popular vote could possibly be in order for a candidate to win the US general election.

<!-- more -->

## Electoral Votes

To win, a candidate must gather at least 270 electoral votes. The best strategy, mathematically speaking, would be to win *more* states each with *fewer* members of the House Of Representatives. This is because each state has a base of 2 members no matter what, and a total number of members that scales with the state population. Below is an image of the most mathematically efficient way to win exactly 270 votes.

**Summary:** A candidate can win with the smallest 39 states plus DC.

## Popular Votes

To win the electoral vote in the state, the candidate must win the popular vote in that state (meaning at least half of the votes), which makes perfect sense, right? So, let's tally up the bottom 39 states, total up their population, and halve it. So, I did exactly that. I downloaded some JSON data from [worldpopulationreview.com](https://worldpopulationreview.com/states) and wrote a script to calculate the population totals for the US and the bottom 39 states plus DC.

```
Total US population    = 336,587,275 (100%)
Pop. of small states   = 145,512,850 (43.23%)
Required popular vote  = 72,756,425 (21.62%)
```

*The output of the program.*

## Conclusion

Although a virtually impossible scenario for a multitide of reasons, if played exactly right, a candidate can become president only winning **21.62%** of the popular vote in the United States. Of course, that will never happen, right?

## Code

```js
// Data is pre-sorted greatest to least populated
import { data } from './state-population-table.js';

// Define the starting ID to count the less populated states' populations
const startId = 11;

// Define the population of the smaller states and the total population
let pop = 0, total = 0;

// Compute a sum total for each metric
for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    total += data[i].pop2024;
    if (i >= startId) {
        pop += data[i].pop2024;
    }
}

// Print results
console.log('Total US population    = ' +
    (total).toLocaleString() + ' (100%)');
console.log('Pop. of small states   = ' +
    (pop).toLocaleString() + ' (' +
    (pop / total * 100).toFixed(2) + '%)');
console.log('Required popular vote  = ' +
    (pop / 2).toLocaleString() + ' (' +
    (pop / 2 / total * 100).toFixed(2) + '%)');
```
