# Bay Area Bridge Travel

This weekend, I traveled far and wide within and around the San Francisco Bay Area, locally known as the Bay Area. On Friday through Monday, I traveled over 200 miles, and crossed 6 bridges to visit 5 cities, including my hometown. Despite all this commute, I only ended up paying $14 total in bridge tolls! Let this story be your guide on how to effectively navigate the complex and expensive web of Bay Area *FasTrak*.

## What is FasTrak?

Because many major cities are separated by water, the Bay Area has 8 major toll bridges to connect these populated areas. At the time of writing this, all of the bridge tolls are $7 to cross, except the Golden Gate Bridge, which depends on the number of axles and carpool status. For me, the Golden Gate (GG) Bridge costs $9.50 to cross. These fees are all paid to *FasTrak*. From Wikipedia:

> The Bay Area Fastrak is a toll collection system operated by the Bay Area Toll Authority (BATA) for the nine-county San Francisco Bay Area. It provides a convenient, cash-free way to pay tolls on bridges and Express Lanes.

## Where are tolls collected?

The Bay Area bridges are only tolled in one direction, where the other direction is free to cross. This makes perfect sense for people with a linear commute - crossing the same bridge to and from work would charge a single bridge toll. Because some bridges run East-West and others run North-South, the toll direction isn't the same for every bridge. Here's a list of each of the Bay Area bridges, its cost, and corresponding toll/free directions.

| Bridge | Region | Toll | Fee Direction | Free Direction |
| ------ | ------ | ---- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Antioch | Antioch - Rio Vista | $7.00 | Northbound | Southbound |
| Benicia/Martinez | Benicia - Martinez | $7.00 | Northbound | Southbound |
| Carquinez | Crockett - Vallejo | $7.00 | Northbound | Southbound |
| Richmond/San Rafael | Richmond - San Rafael | $7.00 | Westbound | Eastbound |
| Bay Bridge | San Francisco - Oakland | $7.00 | Westbound | Eastbound |
| Golden Gate | San Francisco - Sausalito | $9.50 | Southbound | Northbound |
| San Mateo/Hayward | San Mateo - Hayward | $7.00 | Westbound | Eastbound |
| Dumbarton | Palo Alto - Fremont | $7.00 | Westbound | Eastbound |

## My Weekend Commute

For my work commute, I take the Richmond/San Rafael bridge both ways. In the morning, I take the free, eastbound direction, and when coming home, I pay the $7 westbound toll, automatically billed to my *FasTrak* account. So, in total, I pay the bridge toll only once to cross the same bridge twice.

This past weekend, I was full of plans. On Friday, I would need to commute from my home in northern Marin county to Berkeley, in the East Bay. From there, I planned to stay over in San Francisco Friday night so I could join the Marina Run Club on Saturday morning, and then meet Remy to watch Fleet Week (with the Blue Angels) in the afternoon, also in San Francisco. That evening, I had plans to visit Nathan in Lodi. (Creedence Clearwater Revival has a song about this city.) I also wanted to see my family in the East Bay on Saturday night and stay all day Sunday, before heading back to work on Monday. After work on Monday, I wanted to pop into San Francisco before heading home in Marin. I designed a commute to minimize the number of tolls I would pay to cross all these bridges. Let's take a closer look at what I did. (Some city names are redacted for privacy.)

### Friday

1. Start in *hometown* in northern Marin.
1. Drive to Berkeley in the East Bay via Richmond/San Rafael bridge, free eastbound direction.
1. Drive to San Francisco via Bay Bridge, $7 westbound direction.

### Saturday

1. Start in San Francisco.
1. Go running and then watch the airshow.
1. Drive back to *hometown* in northern Marin.
1. Drive to Lodi, via CA-12 which does not cross any *FasTrak* bridges. I needed to cross the Rio Vista drawbridge which is not tolled. Unfortunately, as soon as I got to Rio Vista, the bridge was raised, adding 15 or 20 minutes onto my commute to wait for it to lower.
1. Drive to *parent's hometown* in the East Bay via the Antioch Bridge, free southbound direction.

### Sunday

1. Stayed in *parent's hometown* all day. No bridges crossed.

### Monday

1. Start in *parent's hometown* in the East Bay.
1. Drive to Berkeley, no bridges crossed.
1. Drive to San Francisco via Bay Bridge, $7 westbound direction.

### Tuesday

1. Start in San Francisco.
1. Leave early in the morning to work from home in *hometown* via the Golden Gate Bridge, free northbound direction.

## Summary

Because of my home's geography within the Bay Area, I am able to take advantage of a unique logical principle that allows me to only pay a single bridge toll for clockwise loops around the bay. This is not limited to the Richmond/San Rafael, Bay, and Golden Gate Bridges. All of these loops would allow the driver to pay fewer bridge tolls than the number of bridge crossings:

| Route | \# Bridge Crossings | Total Cost | Mileage\* | Clock Direction | Major Cities |
| ----- | ------------------- | ---------- | --------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Marin (R/SR) East Bay (**Bay**) Peninsula (GG) Marin | 3 | $7 | 53 | CW | San Rafael, Richmond, Oakland, San Francisco |
| Marin (R/SR) East Bay (**SM/H**) Peninsula (GG) Marin | 3 | $7 | 92 | CW | San Rafael, Richmond, San Mateo, Hayward |
| Marin (R/SR) East Bay (**Dum.**) Peninsula (GG) Marin | 3 | $7 | 117 | CW | San Rafael, Richmond, Fremont, Palo Alto |
| Marin (R/SR) East Bay -> South Bay -> Peninsula (GG) Marin | 2 | $0 | 133 | CW | San Rafael, Richmond, San Jose, San Francisco |
| Peninsula (Dum.) East Bay -> South Bay -> Peninsula | 1 | $0 | 53 | CW | Palo Alto, Fremont, San Jose |
| Peninsula (SM/H) East Bay -> South Bay -> Peninsula | 1 | $0 | 76 | CW | San Mateo, Hayward, San Jose |
| Peninsula (Bay) East Bay -> South Bay -> Peninsula | 1 | $0 | 101 | CW | San Francisco, Oakland, Jan Jose |
| North Bay (Antioch) East Bay -> Valley -> North Bay | 1 | $0 | 85 | CCW | Stockton, Rio Vista, Antioch |
| North Bay (B/M) East Bay -> Valley -> North Bay | 1 | $0 | 135 | CCW | Stockton, Benicia, Martinez |
| North Bay (Carq.) East Bay -> Valley -> North Bay | 1 | $0 | 139 | CCW | Stockton, Vallejo, Crockett |

Some of these commutes are completely unreasonable, and there are more here that I did not include. However, these are just a few examples of going for a roll, without paying the toll.
