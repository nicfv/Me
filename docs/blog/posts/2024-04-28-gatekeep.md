## Fresh OS Install

I first wanted to upgrade my Ubuntu version to 24.04, the latest version. (It was only released a few days ago!) I looked up some tutorials which made it seem easy to update from 22.04, which is what I thought I had. Turns out, I was still running 20.04 on my Pi! So I would need to step through the major versions, and I figured that I would prefer a clean install anyway, since I don't keep any data directly on the Pi.

I downloaded the official Ubuntu Server ARM64 image and created a startup disk on a 64GB MicroSD card, but unfortunately I would get no signal when plugging in the Pi to my monitor. After a few tries, I decided to go the easy route and install the official Raspberry Pi imager. After a single try with using that utility, it worked perfectly.

> **Warning:** If you create a startup disk, you will lose *all* existing data on that drive!
