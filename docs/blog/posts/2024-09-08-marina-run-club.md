# Marina Run Club

I am now part of two different running clubs, both with the same acronym! "MRC," for "Marin Running Club" and "Marina Run Club." I've been going to the Marin Running Club for several months now, but this week was my second week attending the Marina Run Club in San Francisco.

Both times with the Marina Run Club, I ran 6 miles and then took a break afterwards to explore the city for a bit before returning to Marin. It is a really cool run - starting at the Marina Green and running to the first post of the Golden Gate Bridge and back. This at least is for the 6 mile course. They also have other distance groups too.

The first week I went I remember it being a bit cloudy in the morning but it cleared up pretty quick and got a nice warm temperature for San Francisco. This past week, there was dense fog traveling into the city and it was really cold. Luckily, I packed a few pairs of clothes for different weather types. You never know what the weather is going to be like in SF. Unfortunately, it stayed cold and foggy during the entire run, so no cool views. Of course, the fog cleared up just a bit after finishing the run.

Like I mentioned earlier, I took some time to explore the city before heading right back home, since the Golden Gate Bridge toll is almost $10. (So might as well make it count!) I walked through Pier 39 (Fisherman's Wharf), Ghirardelli Square, and all the way to the Ferry Building. I was super hungry at this time, and luckily there was a farmer's market going on at the time! So, I bought some fruit and bakery things and ate lunch there by the ferry docks.
