# Resolution Update

We just started week 45 of 2024! Isn't it crazy that there are only 58 days left of this year? A bit over 2 months ago, I wrote about my [2024 New Year's resolution progress](./2024-08-30-resolution-progress.md). I'm pleased to announce that I have made some great progress on this, and I am well on track to fulfilling my resolutions by the end of the year.

## Reminder

What was my New Year's resolution again? Well, I had 2 of them. A "reading" one and a "writing" one.

1. Write 1 article per week (average) on this website, or 52 total in 2024.
1. Read 2 paper books (at least 100 pages each) in 2024.
