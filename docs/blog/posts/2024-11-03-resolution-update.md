# Resolution Update

We just started week 45 of 2024! Isn't it crazy that there are only 58 days left of this year? A bit over 2 months ago, I wrote about my [2024 New Year's resolution progress](./2024-08-30-resolution-progress.md). I'm pleased to announce that I have made some great progress on this, and I am well on track to fulfilling my resolutions by the end of the year.

<!-- more -->

## Reminder

What was my New Year's resolution again? Well, I had 2 of them. A "reading" one and a "writing" one.

1. Write 1 article per week (average) on this website, or 52 total in 2024.
1. Read 2 paper books (at least 100 pages each) in 2024.

## Writing

Like last time, let's start with writing first. As I mentioned in the introduction, we are currently starting week number 45 of the year. I have 44 written articles published since January 1, and this one will be number 45. The math works out so easily!

$$\frac{45\text{ articles}}{45\text{ weeks}} = 100\%\text{ of goal}$$

I am exactly on track with my writing thus far! This is great news, since I thought this would have been the more difficult one to keep on track.

> I only need to publish 7 more articles this year? Wow!

## Reading

As I mentioned in my [last update](./2024-08-30-resolution-progress.md), I had read one book: *Lexicon* by Max Barry. I'm pleased to announce that I have not only completed a second book, but I am quite through a fair portion of yet a third book! I just finished reading *We Solve Murders* by Richard Osman, a 380-page action and murder mystery book. The author's writing style made me laugh several times. Overall it was an incredible book, and would recommend to anyone. I am also about halfway through *Blink* by Malcolm Gladwell, a 250-page psychological book full of short stories on making quick and powerful decisions. That puts me at 2.5 books read so far this year. We are currently only $\approx 84\%$ through the year.

$$\frac{2.50\text{ books read}}{0.84 \times 2.00\text{ books needed}}\approx 149\%\text{ of goal}$$

So I am not only complete with this resolution entirely, I have surpassed it by quite a margin! My pseudo-goal is to finish *Blink* as well by the end of the year. I think that is definitely possible.

## Conclusion

I don't really see a point to write a conclusion here, since it will be the same as my first [progress journal](./2024-08-30-resolution-progress.md). My resolutions for 2025 are still the same. I haven't decided yet what kind of literature I want to publish. Nor what books I will read. Feel free to email me suggestions for either of these if you have recommendations!
