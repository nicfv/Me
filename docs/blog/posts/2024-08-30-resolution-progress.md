# Resolution Progress

We're nearing the end of August already. At the beginning of 2024, I had 2 simple New Year's resolutions. How am I doing? Did I keep them, or stop after a week, like most people?

## Resolutions

Well first of all, what were my New Year's resolutions for 2024? They were based on reading and writing, something I used to love doing (for fun!) but hard-stopped after going off to college. I remember reading a book per week (or in a few weeks) back in middle school. And I'm talking thick books too, like several hundred pages each. It's really sad that I stopped, and ever since then, I couldn't manage to get myself to pick up a book for fun.

1. Write 1 article per week (average) on this website, or 52 total
1. Read 2 books (at least 100 pages each)

## Progress

It's nearing the end of week 35 of 2024, meaning that we are about 67% of the way through the year. As of now, I should have 35 articles written, and 1 book complete and to be about 33% of the way through my second book. Here are the stats.

### Writing

To benchmark this one, all I need to do is count the number of articles on my website that were published since January 1, 2024. I currently have (exactly!) 35 articles written. It will be 36 including this one.

$$\frac{36}{35} \approx 103\% \text{ of my goal}$$

As you can see, I'm actually a little bit ahead of my goal for this resolution, but pretty much right on the nose. What about the other one?


### Reading

I've started and finished one book since the beginning of this year; *Lexicon* by Max Barry, with 390 pages. This meets my criteria of a book over 100 pages. I did most of my reading while travelling, for example the flights or bullet train in Japan. It was a dark fantasy novel with the theme of words having more power than just their meaning. It was an excellent book, although a bit confusing at times, but was super interesting. Unfortunately, while I have read bits of other books, I have not started my "second book" that I plan to finish by the end of the year. That puts me at only one book out of my goal of 2. At this point in the year, I should have about 1.33 books completed to be on track.

$$\frac{1.00}{1.33} \approx 75\% \text{ of my goal}$$

I'm quite a bit behind on this one, but not terribly so. I still have 4 months to read just one book. Most motivated people can achieve this task in a weekend. This should be no sweat for me. I just need to pick a book, and buy or download it.

## Next Year

I'm already formulating my plans for next year, in 2025. I'd very much like to continue my reading and writing. As for my reading, I want to *slowly* ramp it back up, so I'd like to read 3 books next year. *Three whole books!* I know, it's gonna be a toughie for me. But I think I can do it. Young me could easily do this.

For my writing, I want to continue writing articles for my website, but I think I'll take that off as an official resolution. My real goal is to publish some sort of work of writing. I have not completely fleshed this out, so I'm not sure what route I want to take. Some of my ideas include self-publishing an academic paper, or writing a short sci-fi novel and publish through Amazon. Either way, I think 2025 will be an exciting year for me, as long as I stay motivated.
