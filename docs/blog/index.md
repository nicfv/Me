**Announcement**

30 Dec 2023

> This blog has been migrated to [nicfv.com/blog](https://nicfv.com/blog/). The old URL will continue to redirect to the new URL for the time being. Due to registry limitations, only HTTP is redirected. In a few weeks, I will be removing the URL alias, so please use the new URL.

> Within the next 1-2 weeks, this website will be migrated to another URL (likely *nicfv.com/blog*) for maintainability. When this happens, the old URL (currently *blog.nicfv.com*) will continue to work but will redirect to the new site. No other changes are planned at this time.

**A space for my thoughts.**

I don't write anything too serious on here; these are mostly shower thoughts from an engineer. Browse on the navigation menu on the left or type in the search bar at the top to look for articles. Click on the links in the footer to view my homepage, send me an email, or visit my other online presence. Enjoy!
