**A space for my thoughts.**

I don't write anything too serious on here; these are mostly shower thoughts from an engineer. My new year's resolution for 2024 is to write one article per week on average. Browse on the navigation menu on the left or type in the search bar at the top to look for articles. Click on the links in the footer to view my homepage, send me an email, or visit my other online presence. Enjoy!
