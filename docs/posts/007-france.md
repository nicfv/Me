# Family Christmas Vacation to France, 2023

My family and I visit our extended family in France every couple years. We had been planning to travel to France for some time, but we are not good planners. After some frustration and finesse, I was able to find our flights which my dad graciously booked for us all.

## Saturday, December 16

Our first leg was SFO-ZRH (San Francisco to Zurich, Switzerland.) But, the flight didn't depart until 7 PM so we practically had the whole day to ourselves. Unfortunately, my dad tested positive for COVID-19 in the morning, but he was pretty healthy and decided to move along with our plans but just wear masks. In the morning before the flight, we went to a library book sale and then had lunch. It was already getting dark by the time we got to the airport in the late afternoon. I unfortunately had to check my luggage, because the wheels made it just an inch too tall. We got on the Swiss Air 777 plane and took off. The flight was 10 hours and a half, which is never fun. There were some movies and things to do, I tried my hand at the Chess game provided on screen, and could never get close to defeating the AI. I frequently stood up and walked around and actually met a Swiss university researcher, who submits scientific codes to machines like the one where I work. After what felt like days, we finally landed without me getting a wink of sleep. However, this flight was the smoothest trans-Atlantic flight I've ever been on, so kudos, Swiss Air!

## Sunday, December 17

By now, it is Sunday and we are stuck in the Zurich airport for a couple hours. Plenty of the airport shops have walls and walls of chocolate, including my favorite, Toblerone! Our second leg of the trip was ZRH-NCE which was a much shorter flight. It was interesting that we had to take a bus to get to the plane. Finally, around 7 PM local time we land in Nice, grab our baggage (which were the first out on the carousel!), grab our rental car, and head to Cannes. We saw my Grandmother, Jacqueline, briefly before going to bed at our AirBnB (which was in the same apartment complex!) Unfortunately, I didn't get much sleep.

## Monday, December 18

I was feeling very ill this day and pretty sure I know why. Even if I didn't get COVID-19 from my dad, there were no shortage of people coughing on the planes. So unfortunately, I just stayed home and got some rest.

## Tuesday, December 19

I took a COVID test which to no surprise, was positive. I'm hoping that since I've been vaccinated, this will be over quickly. Actually, I am feeling a bit better already from yesterday. I stayed home again to make sure that I can get over this as soon as possible and start to enjoy my vacation.

## Wednesday, December 20

I've nearly recovered this horrendous disease. I had a staple French breakfast, a croissant with raspberry jam. Later, we went out as a family on a short walk in an old but beautifully decorated cemetary and saw the resting site of Jacqueline's aunts and cousin. Then for dinner, my sister made some delicious risotto, but too bad I hadn't recovered my sense of taste yet.

## Thursday, December 21

I made it this far, over the worst and finally feeling better. Today was much more interesting as a result, and I hope that no more words in this journal are wasted on COVID. Despite (still) not getting enough sleep, the day started off to a great start. I woke up at 4:30 and got up around 7:30, a bit before sunrise. We have a view of the Mediterranean Sea from our AirBnB. On top of the spectacular sunrise, there was an awesome silhouette of Corsica, what I would call the "Hawaii of France." After breakfast, we went over to Jacqueline's and all of us went to the Marche Noel, the Christmas Market in downtown Cannes. Like a typical street fair, most of the vendors sold jewelry, but one that was pretty interesting was someone who sold umbrellas that folded the other way to keep the water within, instead of dripping out, when brought inside. We literally bought 100 raviolis and also stopped for crepes. Normally, I go for the sweet ones, with sugar or Nutella, but I wanted to try a savory one so I got a cheese-filled crepe; the crepe was awesome but the cheese was a bit disappointing. My family wanted to do some more shopping but I started getting some brain fog so Jacqueline and I just watched the water fountains. When they were done, we piled into the car and drove to La Croisette where we had a view of Saint Marguerite island. Also, someone was there shooting staged videos of a really expensive car - maybe for a commercial? I looked up the model later and it was a Bentley Continental GT, with the base price of $250,000!

> So, if you ever see a commercial for a Benteley Continental GT that was filmed in Cannes, I was there!

With a car full of Christmas goods, and a phone/camera full of pictures, that was a wrap. Later that evening my dad's cousin Veronique with her 2 grandkids stopped by at Jacqueline's for a visit. For dinner, my mom (who was also sick) and I head back to our "quarantine zone" (a.k.a. the AirBnB) to eat dinner. It will probably be a while before testing negative...

## Friday, December 22

All of us went to Biot today, a fortified old village in the hills. There is a really neat glass workshop where they handmake and sell unique glassware - where the glass is filled with tiny bubbles! We watched the craftsmen make some vases, explored the glass art museum, and I got myself some cups to bring home. After the workshop, we went to the downtown Biot area, where there was a holiday boutique happening. We got some souvenirs and gifts there, and then looked in a beautiful old church there.

After returning to Jacqueline's from Biot, we made those raviolis for lunch from yesterday's market. They were interesting; one side of the ravioli was yellow and the other side was green, and filled with cheese and spinach. They were tasty, but a bit dry with only butter and no sauce.

After lunch, without Jaqueline, we went to Mouans-Sartoux for their sale of santons, which are nativity figurines. Most of them are already painted, but some of them can be bought specifically to be painted. We bought several different santons to add to our growing collection, and afterwards we went to a bakery where my dad got roasted chestnuts. I thought they were nasty...

On the way home we stopped at Lidl, a grocery store and bought way too much stuff. Luckily, we were parked close so it wasn't too much trouble to bring everything out to the car. For dinner I had leftover raviolis and added tomato sauce, and they were much better that way. That's all for today, now I desparately need to catch up on my sleep.

## Saturday, December 23

Today we wrapped gifts in the morning, and then had veal pockets for lunch. It was made like a stew with vegetables, and the veal was very juicy and full of stuffing. After lunch, we drove to the town of Vallauris for shopping and sightseeing, but mainly (gift) shopping. We did again explore the very old Church there. However, on our way out, we watched a Christmas-themed street show, with acrobatics, juggling, and other tricks. We finished the day by ordering pizza from a place called Mister Pizza. I got an Italienne, and it was delicious.
