# Photos

This is a space for photos I took of my travels, just for fun. The way I'm organizing this is based on the format `YYYY/Location`. Use the navigation menu on the left, or the search bar at the top to explore through some of my different adventures. Additionally, you may follow [@nicfvcom](https://www.instagram.com/nicfvcom/) on Instagram for even more photos.

I live in Northern California and many of these locations are local parks and preserves. As of %TODAY%, I have visited [12/50 US states](./map.md).

## Camera
I currently am using a Canon PowerShot A3500 IS, with mainly stock settings. This is my first camera. A few of the earlier photos on this website are also taken with my phone (Samsung Galaxy A10e) camera.
