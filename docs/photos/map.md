I've visited the states in yellow. I currently live in Northern California.

My next dream destination is Yellowstone. If I have enough time, and plan it right, I would love to hit Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming all on the same trip. Unfortunately I don't have the right kind of car to make that trip, so it could be a while before turning that into a reality.
