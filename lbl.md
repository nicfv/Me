## Facilities

My first job at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was with the facilities division in 2019. I had applied through the SULI (Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship) program. On my first day, my then mentor took me on a tour of the lab on a GEM go cart. The lab was amazing. It is a world class science laboratory surrounded by UC Berkeley on one side, and Tilden Park on the other side. It's located on a steep hillside in the Berkeley hills with a beautiful view of the bay and San Francisco, depending on the fog. Good luck finding parking there.

I was hired as an asset integrity verification engineer. One of the first things I had to do was to memorize building numbers, locations, and what they were for. There were a lot of buildings on site. Next, I was made to do equipment field surveys and interpret existing source drawings to piece together assets that made up the mechanical systems in several lab buildings. In particular, the cooling systems for air and water were of interest to my mentor. The deliverables were piping and instrumentation drawings, or airflow schematics in AutoCAD, as well as updated SmartSheet entries for each asset.

Many of the source drawings were very old and outdated which made it a difficult job. Doing field surveys sometimes rose even more questions. Being an asset integrity verification engineer wasn't the most exciting job, however I learned a lot and got a lot out of that internship. The facilities', and my mentor's, mission was to support the ongoing science of the lab, and I believe I contributed to that effort.

## NERSC Systems

My second job at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was with NERSC (the National Energy Research Scientific Computing center) in the systems division.
