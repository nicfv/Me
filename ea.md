## Capital Games

In 2020 during the thick of the pandemic, I worked virtually for Capital Games, a studio within EA, one of the biggest game developers in the world. Capital Games' pride and joy was a mobile game called _Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes_. Of course being a huge Star Wars fan, I started playing that game once I first heard about it. My group lead was a very nice guy, nice enough to gift me in-game items even before I was hired, which probably got me hooked on the game.

The summer that I worked for Capital Games went by very fast, but I still had the time to finish two meaningful projects. The first one was to get me introduced to the admin panel on the game server. My team needed a centralized log of administrator actions, since many of the game administrators were outsourced. An example an admin action is banning a player from the game or gifting items to a player. The main reason for this is for the Capital Games developers to ensure that the game remains fair to all players.

My other project was more long-term and it was completely up to me what tech stack I wanted to use and how I wanted the end result to be like. In fact, I had to start by esentially writing a project proposal called a technical design document that outlined all the tools I was going to use and timeframe estimates for each stage in the project. My project was to show in some way the game's revenue separated by world regions.

What I did for this was create a visual heatmap of the world that updated in real-time to show in-app purchases. The color intensity would be based off of the amount of revenue, separated by country. I built the dashboard so that it was interactive; hovering or clicking on a country would show more details about the recent purchases made. I had to write some of my own code in the game server to stream the data I needed from the back end, but it did not affect gameplay at all.

Just a week before my internship ended, the last of my code was pushed to the production stage and the big reveal was that I got to see and show my visual update in real time. It was so satisfying to see it work in production, and my only regret was that it was a fully remote internship so I could not see it on their big screens in the studio with the rest of my team.
