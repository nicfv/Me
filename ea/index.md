## Capital Games

In 2020, I worked virtually for Capital Games, a studio within EA, one of the biggest game developers in the world. I helped the development of the mobile game called _Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes_ by creating administrative tools for the game developers to obtain instant feedback of the game.

My first project was to create a centralized log of administrator actions to exist on the server admin panel. An example of an administrator action is banning a player from the game or gifting items to a player. The centralized log ensures that the game remains fair and enjoyable for all players.

I had more freedom in my second project. I was tasked with finding a way to display in-game revenue by geographical location and for this I decided to build a __global heatmap of player purchases__. I wrote a project proposal for this and split up my project into smaller tasks to work via the agile methodology. My project ended up being a visual dashboard which displayed a world map that was interactive. I used JavaScript and SVG for the frontend and Java and Redis for the backend to process the revenue data from the game server. I finished the project in time for the end of my internship and my code was pushed to production, and I got to see my program work with real data in real time.
