## Announcement

**27 Dec 2023**: Within the next 1-2 weeks, this website will be migrated to another URL (likely *nicfv.com/blog*) for maintainability. When this happens, the old URL (currently *blog.nicfv.com*) will continue to work but will redirect to the new site. No other changes are planned at this time.

## A space for my thoughts.

I don't write anything too serious on here; these are mostly shower thoughts from an engineer. Browse on the navigation menu on the left or type in the search bar at the top to look for articles. Click on the links in the footer to view my homepage or to send me an email. Enjoy!
